# Development security reports

PRs, the default branch and weekly schedules keep complete CodeQL and OSV
results. Findings remain advisory; scanner execution, selected-input coverage,
JSON/SARIF validation and upload failures remain failing checks. OSV JSON and
SARIF use one exact input list and validate package/version/location identities.
GitHub code-scanning fingerprints deduplicate repeated findings; check summaries
and retained artifacts are the PR report, not a claim of fixed vulnerabilities.
No Issue-writing token or automatic dependency merge is introduced.

OSV inputs:
- `Cargo.lock`

CodeQL languages: rust, python, actions.

Existing reviewed exceptions, tests, release signing and deployment gates are
unchanged. Reusable dependency scans default to strict findings for release
callers. Repository security switches require separate administrative visibility;
a workflow file does not prove that those switches are enabled.
